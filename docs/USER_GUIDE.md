You can record up to 12 sites per trail (Graveyard and Parish).

Record GPS first for accurate location data. Photos from your gallery may include GPS from when they were taken.

## Adding site details

## Complete & Archive Trail

When you have finished recording and are ready to hand off your trail:

## Logging back in after archiving

After you archive a trail and log back in with the same email, you'll see **Welcome back, [name]. Let's set up your next trail.** Enter the parish and graveyard for your new location, then tap **Create My Trails**. Your new trails will use the parish names you enter (e.g. Ardmore Graveyard Trail, Ardmore Parish Trail).

## Quick tips

**Open a trail first** — Tap Trails → Graveyard or Parish before recording. Record captures into the trail you last opened.

**Same email = restore** — On a new device, enter the same email and tap Start recording Trails. Your data will load automatically from the cloud.

**After archiving** — Log back in with the same email to set up your next trail. You'll see the parish setup screen to name your new location.
