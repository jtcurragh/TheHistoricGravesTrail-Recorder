After capturing a photo, add the site name and story so it counts as validated. Tap **Trails** → open **Graveyard** or **Parish** → tap a site in the list.

| Field | Required | Word limit |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Site name | Yes | — |
| Category | Yes | — |

**Category:** The list changes depending on your trail type. Graveyard trails show options like Gravestone, High Cross, Church, and Holy Well. Parish trails show options like Vernacular Building, Holy Well, and Stone Bridge. Pick the one that best fits your site.

## Managing your trail

Tap **Trails** in the bottom bar to see your Graveyard and Parish trails. Open one to view and edit its sites. You can reorder, edit details, or delete a site. Your work saves automatically on your device.

## Syncing your data

Tap **Sync** in the bottom bar. Your data uploads to the cloud so it’s safe and can be restored on another device.

**What sync does:** It sends your recordings from this phone or tablet to the cloud. You can work offline when recording. Sync when you have a connection.

**If you see “Sync problem” or “Failed to fetch”:** Don’t worry — your work is safe on this device. This usually means the internet connection dropped or was too weak. Try again when you have a good connection (e.g. WiFi). If it keeps failing, contact your area editor.

**Green:** Your work is saved to the cloud.  
**Amber:** You have items waiting to upload. They will sync when you’re online.  
**Red:** Sync failed. Your data is still on this device. Tap **Sync now** again when connected.

## Creating a brochure

![Brochure setup](images/brochure-setup.png)

Brochure setup is best done on a desktop or laptop. Tap **Export** in the bottom bar. **Digital Brochure** lets you set up the cover and generate a PDF. You need at least 8 validated POIs.

**Brochure setup fields:**

| Field | Where it appears |
|-------|------------------|
| Cover title | Cover page |
| Cover photo | Cover page (optional) |
| Community group name | Cover footer, page 2 |
| Introduction | Page 2, under "INTRODUCTION" (75 words) |
| Funded and supported by | Page 2, sponsor names |
| Credits & acknowledgements | Page 2, under "CREDITS & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" (40 words) |

**Cover layout:** The cover shows the app logo in the top-right corner. If you add a cover photo, it appears below the title. The title and logo sit on a teal band above the photo. You can leave the cover photo blank for a plain teal cover.

After saving, tap **Generate Brochure** to create the PDF.

## Exporting your data

Tap **Export** in the bottom bar.

- **Export (ZIP):** Downloads trails as a ZIP file (text, KML, photos) to share with coordinators.
- **Import Trail ZIP:** (Pro coordinators only) If you have a ZIP file from another device, you can import it here.
- **Digital Brochure:** Set up cover details and generate a PDF brochure — requires at least 8 validated POIs.

## Complete & Archive Trail

When you have finished recording and are ready to hand off your trail:

1. **Download the ZIP export** — Tap **Export** → **Export (ZIP)** and save the file.
2. **Generate and save the digital brochure PDF** — Complete brochure setup and tap **Generate Brochure**.
3. Tick both checkboxes in the **Complete & Archive Trail** section.
4. Tap **Complete & Archive Trail** and confirm with **Yes, Archive Trail**.

This marks your trail as archived in the cloud and removes it from this device. You must be online to archive. Your data stays safely stored in the cloud.

## Logging back in after archiving

After you archive a trail and log back in with the same email, you'll see **Welcome back, [name]. Let's set up your next trail.** Enter the parish and graveyard for your new location, then tap **Create My Trails**. Your new trails will use the parish names you enter (e.g. Ardmore Graveyard Trail, Ardmore Parish Trail).

## Tips for volunteers

**Open a trail first** — Tap Trails → Graveyard or Parish before recording. Record captures into the trail you last opened.

**Validate for the brochure** — Add site name and story so it counts toward the 8 required for the PDF.

**Same email = restore** — On a new device, enter the same email and tap Start recording Trails. Your data will load automatically from the cloud.

**After archiving** — Log back in with the same email to set up your next trail. You'll see the parish setup screen to name your new location.

**Multiple photos:** If you have several photos ready, choose them all at once from the gallery. The progress bar shows how many are done. Great for when you’ve taken photos elsewhere and want to add them quickly.
